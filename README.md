### Minecraft Neural Evolution ###

This is a code sample which simulates a minecraft game and uses the [PyreNet](https://github.com/Poppro/PyreNet) library to perform deep neural network genetic evolution via reinforcement learning.

The project is self-contained and is intended mainly for demonstrational/proof of concept purposes. Because of this, overall code quality has been sacrificed in favor of development speed and efficiency.

Thus far the project has generated promising results and AI has successfully been able to learn to mine diamond given sufficient training.
